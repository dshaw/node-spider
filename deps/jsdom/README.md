# jsdom

CommonJS implementation of the DOM intended to be platform independent and as minimal/light as possible while completely adhering to the w3c DOM specifications.

Currently Implemented and w3c Compliant:

  - DOM Level 1 (html/svg/xml) 
  - Browser (BOM) Augmentation (getElementsByClassName, getElementById, etc..)


**Note**: Running the tests now requires [mjsunit.runner][]

see: [testlog][] for w3 test compliance
